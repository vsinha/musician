Experimenting with some music theory primitives. Maybe building towards some tools to help me practice, but not strictly.

# Setup on my m1 macbook pro

```
brew install portaudio
pip3 install pyaudio numpy scipy
```

# Run

```
# play some simple music
python play_audio.py

# test
python -m unittest discover
```
